## A bit about me:
Hello! I'm Frankie Murcia, a passionate developer with experience in modern web technologies. I use Python for back-end development and have strong front-end skills using React, Node.js, and other frameworks. I have also learned Java and C++ in the past. I am a recent graduate from California State University, Dominguez Hills (CSUDH) with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Fluent in Spanish, I'm dedicated to creating equitable and inclusive experiences on the web.

Currently, I'm deeply engaged in a smart farming project, leveraging machine learning to analyze soil data for predictive insights and patterns. By combining my computer science skills with UX Design principles, I aim to create solutions that are both technically sound and user-friendly.

I'm excited to connect and explore how I can contribute my expertise in computer science, UX Design, and machine learning to make a positive impact in the digital space.

Feel free to contact me.
